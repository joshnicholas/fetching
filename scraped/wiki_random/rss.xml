Opium lamps differ from conventional lamps for lighting in that they are designed to channel an exact amount of heat upward through their funnel-shaped chimneys. An opium pipe, its pipe-bowl primed with a small dose of opium known as a "pill," was held over the opium lamp causing the opium to vaporize and allowing the smoker to inhale the vapors.[1]</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_lamp</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Shadow of a Face</title><link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_a_Face</link><description>Shadow of a Face is a monument to abolitionist Harriet Tubman in Newark, New Jersey's Harriet Tubman Square designed by architect and artist Nina Cooke John.
