Ramsey Campbell, who dropped the initial from his name in subsequent publications. Initially announced under the title The Box in the Priory [1] it was released in 1964 by Arkham House in an edition of 2,009 copies and was the author's first book. The stories are part of the Cthulhu Mythos. Campbell had originally written his introduction to be included in the book The Dark Brotherhood and Other Pieces under the title "Cthulhu in Britain". However, Arkham's editor, August Derleth, decided to use it here (retitled "A Word from the Author").</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inhabitant_of_the_Lake_and_Less_Welcome_Tenants</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
