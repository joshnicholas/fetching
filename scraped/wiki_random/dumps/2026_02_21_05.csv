This type of malocclusion has no vertical overlap or contact between the anterior incisors.[1] The term ""open bite"" was coined by Carevelli in 1842 as a distinct classification of malocclusion.[2][3] Different authors have described the open bite in a variety of ways.[4] Some authors have suggested that open bite often arises when overbite is less than the usual amount. Additionally, others have contended that open bite is identified by end-on incisal relationships. Lastly, some researchers have stated that a lack of incisal contact must be present to diagnose an open bite.[5][6]"
